# CV task
### the final model is deployed at `https://huggingface.co/spaces/saatvik1879/CVtask` do check it out üòÅ
## aquiring the datasets
My first thought was to train a model locally for this task. but,I couldn't get pytorch running locally.Then I thought of running it on colab but the number of images in the file are too large and It will take quite a lot of time to train my own model. So,I finally came to the conclusion of using openCV and kaggle.then that didn't workout so I had to train a CV model on my macbook without GPU 

(my first idea was that I will use opencv to extract features and then use random forest classifier on the extracted features to perform classification but that didn't workout quite well )



the images used to train my model will be a subset of this dataset(more specifially I used omly the test folder of this dataset because that is all my mac could handle )-
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/gender-recognition-200k-images-celeba




So,to test the performance of the model I will use a small subset of the dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset

## building model

### attempt 1: using dlib (unsuccessful one)

#### this whole attempt was a mess and I finally scapped it to read the details of it read below else move to attempt 2

first I shall preprocess the images  then the model bascically takes preprocessed images and performs feature extaction on them.the featues extracted are the ones which are not covered by mask and then are stored in a feature vector. then the feature vector is passed to the random forest classifier to perform classification.

#### importing necessary libraries
importing libraries like  cv2, randomforestclassifier etc.
#### preprocessing the image
First, It will find where the faces are loacated and crops the image such that face is centered using dlib.

and then it is resized to 200x200 and converted into greyscale.

#### extracting feature vector from preprocessed images 
I am using openCV to extract features like hairstyle,facial geometry, skin tone and geometry features.

first I am using dlib's shape predictor to find the locations of landmarks of face.


the features extracted here are `hair texture`, `skin tone` and `skin texture`.

#### hair texture
first ,the region containing hair has been extracted i.e. from landmarks extracted from the landmark_detector of cv2

then cv2.laplacian() is applied which is an edge detection algorithmn.It captures texture and variations in hair

.var() operator then calculates the spread of pixels higher variance indicates textured hairstyle whereas low variance indicates smoother texture.

#### skin tone
for skin tone I am first cropping out the forehead region and then taking out the mean of the pixel values o get the skin tone

#### skin texture
I am taking the forrehead region cropped out from above and applying laplacian on it. 

#### random forests 
at last I use random forests to process the feature vector. and classify it according to the gender

#### problems faced:
first I couldn't get the main library dlib to run
so I tried openCV's alternatives but that didn't work out either as i couldn't load the required models from opencv too so I skipped the part where dlib was required and just used some simple opencv algoritmns but due to that the accuracy (=0.56)of the model suffered quite a bit.so now we're back to the drawing board and now comes attempt 2.
### attempt 2: using transfer learning
the working mechanism is the final model is that first it takes the image and finds faces in the images and passes the found images to the model and the model then applies convolutions on the image to finally pass it through a sigmoid to determine the gender
TH model has been deployed on https://huggingface.co/spaces/saatvik1879/CVtask(please dm me if the space is private I will turn it into public if I forget)
#### importing the necessary libraries
import libraries like opencv, os, tf, numpy,etc. the vgg model and dense,pooling layers 
#### preprocessing function
first the image is read from its path. and then the grayscale version of the image is stored in a variable, this variable is then passed to opencv's cascade classifier which finds the coordinates at which faces are present.and the image is cropped such that such that this face is at the center of the image. the lower half of the face's pixels are converted into black pixels.then this is passed tf.keras.applications.vgg16's preprocess function. If no face is found (It is happening in the case of the image being already cropped) I am passing using the whole image at the step where I cropped only the face.
#### preparing the data
to prepare the data I am taking all the images and passing them through the preprocess the function and appended to the list named data

P.S. I dared to save and load this data and upload this data onto colab and use its gpu to train my model and use it there which first crashed colab then my computer crashed as the size of the data is 11 gb

#### test train split and using data generators
I am splitting my data into testing and training data with a testing size of 0.2 and using data generators for data augumentationa and supplying this enormous data to the model
#### actual building the model
I am using transfer learning in which I am using vgg16 pretrained model 
#### model architecture

the base model is the vgg16 model excluding the top 
and I included the following layers after it: 1.`global avg pooling` , 2. `dense(512,1024) layer`, 3.`dense(1024,1) layer` and 4.`a sigmoid`

#### compiling the model

The optimizer I am using is `adam optimizer` ,loss function - `BCEloss` and `accuracy` for metrics

#### training the model 
As I was using a macbook It took 20 mins to run half a epoch üò≠. even with this `the model had an accuray of 89%`.
#### saving and loading model
I used model.save to save the model and load_model to load the model

### deploying the attempt 2 model
I had a few problems while deploying because I didn't pass my own images before the deployment to verify. So, I was getting an error when submitting so I had to run few images locally and I found that the problem was the dimensions didn't match(I know noob mistake but this didn't stike my mind )So, I finally got the application to work. her are few images for example (you can use the face-mask-dataset to test the model yourself!)the model is deployed at https://huggingface.co/spaces/saatvik1879/CVtask
